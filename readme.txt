== Description ==

Neat and simple theme, focused on blogging. 

Its features are Responsive Layout, Custom Colors, Social Links(*), 
Custom Header Image (featuring parallax scrolling) and a default 
background image (geometric pattern).

TheFabbrick enhances the time-line look and feel by placing entry dates 
firstly and slightly offset, just beside their respective entry titles.

There is a Related Posts Links section that displays similar posts by tag just 
after each entry in order to improve the visitors' experience.

Formatted posts are displayed directly in the preview mode (standard posts 
display excerpts by default).

In addition, the two-columns layout can become a simple one-column design 
just by removing all widgets from the sidebar (you can use the main 
menu for extra navigability), so readers can focus better on your content.

(*)Linking to any of the following sites will display its icon in the 
   Social Links Menu location of the theme:

   CodePen
   Digg
   Dribbble
   Dropbox
   Email (mailto: links)
